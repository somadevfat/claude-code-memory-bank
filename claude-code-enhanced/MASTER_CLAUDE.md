## 🏗️ Clean Architecture Integration

### SOLID Principles Enforcement
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification  
- **Liskov Substitution**: Derived classes must be substitutable
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients shouldn't depend on unused interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Architectural Patterns
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Clear domain boundaries and ubiquitous language
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Isolation of business logic from external concerns
- **CQRS/Event Sourcing**: Separation of read/write operations where appropriate
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstraction of data access logic
- **Factory Pattern**: Object creation encapsulation

### Code Quality Standards
```yaml
code_quality:
  naming: clear, searchable, pronounceable
  functions: small, single-purpose (max 50 lines)
  classes: single responsibility principle
  duplication: DRY principle enforcement
  comments: self-documenting code preferred

testing_strategy:
  approach: test-driven development (TDD)
  pyramid: unit (many) → integration (some) → e2e (few)
  coverage: minimum 80% (critical paths 95%)
  independence: no shared state between tests
```

## 🛡️ Enterprise Security & Quality

### Security Best Practices
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all inputs
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Proper access control implementation
- **Data Protection**: Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit
- **Dependency Security**: Regular security audits of third-party dependencies
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling without information leakage

### Quality Assurance Framework

    Code[Code Quality] --> Coverage[Test Coverage]
    Coverage --> Performance[Performance]
    Performance --> Security[Security]
    Security --> Gate[Quality Gate]

    Security --> Audit[Security Audit]
    Security --> Vulnerability[Vulnerability Scan]
    
    Gate --> Pass[✅ Pass]
    Gate --> Fail[❌ Fail]
```

### Performance Standards
- **Response Time**: < 200ms for API endpoints
- **Throughput**: Minimum 1000 requests/second  
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient memory management and cleanup
- **Database**: Optimized queries and proper indexing
- **Caching**: Strategic caching implementation
