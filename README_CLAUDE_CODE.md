## 🏗️ Clean Architecture & Code Quality Features

### Code Quality Principles Integration

#### SOLID Principles Enforcement
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Derived classes must be substitutable
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients shouldn't depend on unused interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

#### Clean Code Standards
- **Meaningful Names**: Clear, searchable, pronounceable naming
- **Function Design**: Small, single-purpose functions with descriptive names
- **Comment Guidelines**: Code that explains itself with minimal comments
- **Error Handling**: Proper exception handling without obscuring logic
- **Consistent Formatting**: Automated formatting and style consistency

#### Architectural Patterns
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Clear domain boundaries and ubiquitous language
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Isolation of business logic from external concerns
- **CQRS/Event Sourcing**: Separation of read/write operations where appropriate
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstraction of data access logic
- **Factory Pattern**: Object creation encapsulation

### Testing Strategy Integration

#### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**: Failing test → Implementation → Refactoring
- **Test First Approach**: Tests drive design and implementation
- **Refactoring Safety**: Comprehensive test coverage enables safe refactoring

#### Testing Pyramid
```
    E2E Tests (Few)

- **Mock Strategy**: Strategic use of mocks for external dependencies

### Code Quality Metrics

#### Static Analysis Integration
